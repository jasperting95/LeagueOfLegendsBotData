# Bot Bot
Author: Jeremy Jasper Ting
Project Start Date: 2/9/2015
Language: Python 3.4.2

Using the official League of Legends API, Bot Bot (found in main.py) executes a command to retrieve Featured Games data and parses the data to find bot lane compositions. A valid bot lane composition consists of one meta adc champion and one meta support champion. The lists of meta adc champions and meta support champions are found in meta_adcs.txt and meta_supports.txt respectively. Bot Bot saves all the data into bot_bot_data.txt, and the data can be printed using print_data.py.

This was a simple project that I used to learn how to use APIs and manipulate json data using python.

If you wish to use this, you will have to use your own LoL API key.
